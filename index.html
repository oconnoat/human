                    The computer is disappearing. It's gone from the early days of multi-tonne adding
                    machine to being small enough to embed in a pair of wireless earphones. Along
                    the way they've become so pervasive as to be invisible. We stop recognising
                    them because they are ubiquitous.

                    The presence of a computer in every device has contributed to the notion that
                    software is eating the world: more and more tasks that were undertaken in the
                    real world with atoms are achieved by switching digital bits. They have become
                    easier to use and more powerful, but how far can we take it?

                    Xerox PARC is a landmark in the history of computing. PARC labs is where the
                    mouse-and-window concept came from, they were working on pad-type devices in
                    the early 90s, and they invented key networking technologies. Steve Jobs
                    famously visited their lab one day, and some months later the Apple Lisa,
                    the Mac's ancestor, was born.

                    One of PARC's researchers was Mark Weiser, and he was the one to coin the
                    concepts of 'calm technology' and 'ubiquitous' computing. It was a compelling
                    vision: the computers as part of the fabric of the world needed to compete
                    differently for our attention, they needed to instill calm rather than provoke
                    alarm. I think the current model is far from that.

                    I know it's a problem for me, I am constantly on twitter, facebook, email,
                    messaging services. My phone buzzes with alerts and more. I want this to be
                    better, I would like a calmer environment: I want to see machine intelligence
                    embedded and fit our needs. In short, it needs to be humane.

                 We started by calling these types of systems 'intelligent', but that might have
                 been a bit of a reach. Then we started calling them adaptive, personalised, and
                 contextual. that made more sense, they respond to individuals based on the
                 situation. But
                 they probably increased the sense of drowning rather than decreasing it.
                 I want calm, I want to see humanity in my computing.

                For my work, I've been dealing for a while with the questions of how to support
                different kinds of users. Experts are different from novices, but expertise is
                a many-sided thing. I often help family memebrs and friends fix their laptops,
                and solve other problems with their devices. I often don't know what the answer
                is, but I do know how to google. It's been shown that skill with the information
                system can outperform domain knowledge.

                I apply my work to questions about __content__, especially text. There are rules
                of thumb that guess about 4/5ths of human knowledge is embedded in what we call
                unstructued information. I am interested in how to help experts get information
                out of text, and how to get information into textual form.

                I've looked a lot recently at an area called 'topic modelling'. It's been very
                popular in the natural language, search, translation, history and even literary
                areas. The problem is a simple one: computers are dumb, and they don't
                understand language. What tricks can use use about what they are good at
                counting mostly to help us gain insight?

                Topic modelling works on the principles of the distributional hypothesis:
                words of a feather flock together.
                You can get a computer to count how words arise together in a number of ways.
                Different models give you different insights. This, for examples, shows how
                you can learn underlying concepts such as gender from sufficiently large word
                collections

                I'm also interested in looking at how people use their tools, and manage their
                knowledge.When you try and build software you're balancing the practical and
                interesting on both sides. What can I do with a computer that's interesting to
                me and useful for you? I still run into this problem, I use paper notes but have
                not found a workable way to digitise them.

                One example of this kind of interest is frame by google in these terms:
                people think in terms of 'things' not 'strings'. String is a term of a
                sequence of letters as represented in a computer program. The fact that we use
                labels to name things means they often are confusing, collide, or fragment.

                I've worked in how historians store their knowledge about these things in
                semantic storage. This can be rather complicated, but the value can be large
                when those semantic stores are connected to each other, or to other databases.
                It's part of the idea that you should be able to ask questions of the internet,
                not merely request documents.

                I'd like to work on more ways to embed machine intelligence into content. I'm
                especially interested in how content remixing, authoring, and collaboration can
                move towards a more humane, contextual way of doing things. How can we make
                content that is appropriate for long-form Sunday afternoon reading as well as
                a quick video update?

                More importantly, how can we do it so that the content consumer can properly
                inquire about where the content came from, what the basis for its claims are,
                and how to share it for their own network? While I do think that citizens and
                journalists and academics are all contributing increasingly in the same content
                spaces, I don't think that means that every article should be 140 characters.

                I like to talk about it being the sweet spot of collaboration. The idea is to
                automate the things that are hard for humans but easy for computers, while
                helping to find the things that are hard for computers, or hard for both.
                Computers can help by speeding things up, by repeating things lots of times, and

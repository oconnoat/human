# Humaan-Computer Engagement

The computer is disappearing. It's gone from the early days of multi-tonne adding
machine to being small enough to embed in a pair of wireless earphones. Along
the way they've become so pervasive as to be invisible. We stop recognising
them because they are ubiquitous.

The presence of a computer in every device has contributed to the notion that
software is eating the world: more and more tasks that were undertaken in the
real world with atoms are achieved by switching digital bits.

This has tremendous implications for how we organise our lives. The revolution
of the last decade has been to democratise the power to create, share, remix.
At the same time it has helped create a torrent of 24-hour, seamless content.

But here's the question: as human society gets more computerised, can we make
computers more sociable and humane?

Xerox PARC is a landmark in the history of computing. PARC labs is where the
mouse-and-window concept came from, they were working on pad-type devices in
the early 90s, and they invented key networking technologies. Steve Jobs famously visited their lab one day, and some months later the Apple Lisa, the Mac's ancestor, was born.

One of PARC's researchers was Mark Weiser, and he was the one to coin the concepts of 'calm technology' and 'ubiquitous' computing. It was a compelling vision: the computers as part of the fabric of the world needed to compete differently for our attention, they needed to instill calm rather than provoke alarm. I think the current model is far from that.

I know it's a problem for me, I am constantly on twitter, facebook, email, messaging services. My phone buzzes with alerts and more. I want this to be better, I would like a calmer environment: I want to see machine intelligence embedded and fit our needs. In short, it needs to be humane.

We started by calling these types of systems 'intelligent', but that might have
been a bit of a reach. Then we started calling them adaptive, personalised, and contextual.
that made more sense, they respond to individuals based on the situation. But
they probably increased the sense of drowning rather than decreasing it. I want to go back to calm, I want to see humanity in my computing.

For my work, I've been dealing for a while with the questions of how to support
different kinds of users. Experts are different from novices, but expertise is
a many-sided thing. I often help non-technical colleagues fix their laptops,
and solve other problems with their devices. I often don't know what the answer
is, but I do know how to google. It's been shown that skill with the information
system can outperform domain knowledge.
